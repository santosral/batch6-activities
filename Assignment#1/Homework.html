            <h1>Name variables so that other developers can understand your code better. 
                This is a skill you need to nurture</h1>
                <p>
                    Variables are a central component of programming and they need to be taken seriously. 
                    By coming up with clear, concise, and consistent variable names, you can make communication 
                    between yourself and developers more efficient, and your code labels easier to interpret and 
                    understand.
